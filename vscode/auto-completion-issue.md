# Auto completion/suggestion widget

Usually you can trigger the auto-completion auto-suggestion widget with the shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Space`
- `Opt+Esc`

If the shortcut doesn't work you may be using multiple Inputs on you Mac and the default shortcut to switch between inputs is `Ctrl+Space`.

Open `Preferences` > `Keyboard` > `Input Methods`

Verify if the shortcut is enabled on the system and change it or disable it. Or use `Opt+Esc` in Vscode.
